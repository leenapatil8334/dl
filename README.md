#Forecasting USD/INR Exchange Rate using Time Series & Deep Learnin
Project â€“ Python, Pandas, PyCaret, FB Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM, 
Built a time series forecasting model for USD/INR exchange rates to help import/export companies estimate currency trends.

Preprocessed 12,649 records, handled 5% missing data with forward fill, and applied log/differencing for stationarity.

Explored multiple models: ARIMA, FB Prophet, XGBoost, and PyCaret AutoML; selected LSTM as final model (RMSE: 0.0691).
